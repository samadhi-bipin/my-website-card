                    { text: "Because it uniquely blends core research subjects with applied industry engagement, unlike programs in Nepal.", score: 20, reasoning: "This is a strong answer. It directly references the unique structure of the course and links it to your career goals, demonstrating genuine interest and thorough research." },

They have property valued at over NPR 20 million, so they can send money as needed.", score: 5, reasoning: "While your family's assets are noted, this answer lacks specific planning and doesn't align with the detailed budget in your application." },
                    { text: "I plan to get a part-time job as soon as I arrive, which should cover all my living expenses.", score: -10, reasoning: "This is a very weak answer. Relying solely on potential part-time work is risky and contravenes visa requirements." },

It presents a very strong case for your intention to return." },

Officers look for deeper professional and personal ties that pull you back to your home country." },

                    { text: "My long-term goal has always been to build my own firm in Nepal. The Australian work experience is a stepping stone to that, not the final destination. My family obligations, especially to my mother-in-law, are also in Nepal.", score: 20, reasoning: "This is a very strong response. It reinforces your long-term plan and backs it up with a non-negotiable family tie, making your intention to return highly credible." },
                    { text: "That's a good question. I would have to weigh my options at that time, but my current plan is to return.", score: -15, reasoning: "This answer shows significant hesitation and weakens your case. A genuine temporary entrant should have a clear and unwavering intention to return." },

I believe I can make a bigger impact in Nepal's developing HR sector than I could in Australia's mature market.", score: 10, reasoning: "This is a good answer that focuses on professional incentives. It would be stronger if it also mentioned personal ties." }

Our plan to return is a shared one, anchored by our family and professional goals there.", score: 15, reasoning: "This is a confident answer that presents you and your husband as a unified team with a clear, shared goal. It addresses the officer's concern directly." },
                    { text: "He will support my decision, as my career is the primary reason for this journey.", score: 5, reasoning: "This answer is a bit weak as it makes the decision sound one-sided. A visa officer prefers to see a joint commitment to the return plan." },
                    { text: "We would have to see. If he gets a very good opportunity, it would be difficult to leave.", score: -15, reasoning: "This raises another red flag.

This answer is specific, links directly to course subjects, and identifies a clear market need. It shows you have a real, actionable business plan." },
                    { text: "I will bring modern HR practices and better strategies to help them grow.", score: 5, reasoning: "This is too generic. It doesn't show a deep understanding of the specific needs of SMEs or how your research degree is uniquely suited to address them." },
